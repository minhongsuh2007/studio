- Accent color: Light yellow (#F1C40F) to highlight key UI elements and provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for its clean, modern, and neutral appearance, making the UI easy to read and non-distracting.

- Subtle animations during image processing to provide visual feedback to the user.
